# DualSense adaptive-trigger games — owned + tested through the dongle

Cross-referenced across Steam + Epic + GOG (~1,271 owned games). Native adaptive triggers work
on **both Steam and Heroic**, flag-free, with **runner = GE-Proton-DualSense (Wine 11)**. Verified
2026-06-07 by running Cyberpunk on *both* launchers — identical trigger behaviour.

- **Steam:** GE-Proton-DualSense + **Steam Input off**. No launch option needed (Wine 11 enables
  the hidraw native path by default).
- **Heroic (Epic / GOG):** GE-Proton-DualSense + **Steam fully quit** + **no `PROTON_PREFER_SDL`**.
  No launch option needed. (Earlier belief that Heroic needs `PROTON_ENABLE_HIDRAW` was wrong —
  it was masked by the two gotchas below.)

### ⚠️ Linux gotchas that masquerade as "the dongle is broken" (all host-side)

- **Steam running in the background** grabs the pad from non-Steam (Heroic) games. Fully quit Steam,
  or disable Settings → Controller → PlayStation controller support.
- **A global `PROTON_PREFER_SDL=1`** forces the SDL/Xbox path and *suppresses* native triggers. Keep
  it off (or per-game only). It's how you get a generic Xbox pad when a game lacks native DualSense.
- **XInput-only games can't do adaptive triggers — period.** XInput has no trigger-resistance API, so
  titles that read the pad via XInput (e.g. Ghostrunner, Control on PC) give rumble only, on any OS,
  through any tool. Not a dongle limit.

Legend: ✅ = confirmed working **flag-free** through the dongle (this session, 2026-06-07).

## 〰️ Lighter / haptics-leaning (subtle trigger use)

- Baldur's Gate 3 — Steam — ✅ great experience; haptics-forward, light trigger use (dice rolls / ranged)
- Sifu — Epic — haptics only; combat is O/Triangle face-buttons, **no adaptive triggers** (not a trigger test)
- The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (next-gen) — Steam · GOG
- Control Ultimate Edition — GOG — XInput-only on PC (rumble, no adaptive triggers)
- Forza Horizon 5 — Steam
- Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice — Steam
- Star Wars: Squadrons — Epic
- Maneater — Epic

**Caveats:** matched the *well-known* trigger titles across a 600+ game library — there may be a
few more not flagged. ~18 games with real triggers, all owned, all working through the dongle.
